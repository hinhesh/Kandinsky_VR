# Kandinsky_VR
I made a simple VR experience using A_Frame which is javascript web framework for VR.
Here are the steps : 
1) Open your terminal
2) Copy and paste :'git clone git@github.com:hinhesh/Kandinsky_VR.git'
3) write 'cd Kandinsky_VR'
4) write 'open .'
5) Click on index.html on the repo
6) You can move the camera with the arrows of your keybord and the orientation with your mouse
